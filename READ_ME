This was produced as an independent study project for UMD CMSC499. It is broken, and needs a bit more work also currently uses fake data.

This app will work with the database that I have set up. I highly recommend using a different set up or one that allows the database
to talk with the app directly instead of going through the server intermediary and create the necessary php pages... (the pages and database
are secured, so I will not be sharing that.) 

The Login and main page activities are straight forward.

The MyList activity is the one that shows the name of the lists of the coupons or products. There is one activity that works for both
depending on what gets passed in.

The coupon list activity and product list activity are the lists for the coupons and products, these actually show the items and arent just
the list name.

When the person scans a product from the main page, the product list activity opens up and handles the actual scanning, which is done by 
a third party scanner and returns the result for us to search
